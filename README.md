# Overview

Rust code written for applying and testing my understanding of theory I've learnt in the area
of zero-knowledge proofs.

Each directory has tests for the binary crates in the respective `src/bin` subdirectory.
Navigating to any of the top-level directories and running `cargo test` should be enough to run
the associated tests.

## Foundational Knowledge Playgrounds

- `arithmetic/` contains binary crates representing simple statements as arithmetic circuits
- `boolean/` contains binary crates representing simple statements as boolean circuits
- `bulletproofs/` contains binary crates implementing solutions to the exercises in module 3 of
  the RareSkills online book on zero-knowledge proofs, such as:
    - linearly scaling zero-knowledge proof of inner product of two vectors
    - logarithmically scaling zero-knowledge proof of inner product of two vectors using
    recursive algorithm in Bulletproofs paper
- `ec_playground/` contains binary crates using basic elliptic curve functionality from the
`ark-ec` crate, such as:
    - arithmetic of elliptic curve group elements
    - encoding linear equations using elliptic curve group elements
    - pairing operation between pairs of elliptic curve group elements in different elliptic
    curve groups
- `plonk/` contains binary crates implementing parts of the PlonK protocol, such as:
    - representing simple statements as PlonK-ish airthmetic circuits
    - permutation arguments for different cases of wire sets having copy constraints among them
- `polynomial_playground/` contains binary crates using basic polynomial functionality from the
  `ark-ff` and `ark-poly` crates, such as:
    - interpolation of finite field elements over nth roots of unity in a finite field to
    obtain a polynomial which interpolates the vector's values (with respect to the nth roots
    of unity being the evaluation points associated with the values in the vector to
    interpolate)
    - simple application of the Schwartz-Zippel lemma to check the equality of two vectors of
    finite field elements by interpolating the two vectors, evaluating the resulting
    polynomials at a random field element, and comparing the results
- `qap/` contains binary crates representing rank-one constraint systems (R1CS) as quadratic
arithmetic programs (QAPs), and covers aspects such as:
    - representing a matrix/vector product equation equality check using interpolated
    polynomials and polynomial evaluation
    - evaluating a polynomial with a structured reference string (SRS)
    - evaluating a QAP on SRS's generated by trusted setup and verifying the QAP equation
    equality holds via pairing operation for elliptic curve groups
- `r1cs/` contains binary crates representing arithmetic circuits of statements as
vector/matrix types in the `nalgebra` crate and verifying solutions to these statements, such
as the three-colouring problem for the Australian territories

## Implementations of Simple Statement Proofs using Zero-Knowledge Protocols

- `bulletproofs/src/bin/chapter_11.rs` is a binary crate implementing a linearly scaling
zero-knowledge range proof using the Bulletproofs protocol
- `plonk/src/bin/preparation_prover_and_verifier_phases.rs` is a binary crate implementing a
zero-knowledge proof of a solution to a simple equation using the PlonK protocol and the KZG
polynomial commitment scheme, with non-interactivity via application of the Fiat-Shamir
heuristic
- `qap/src/bin/verify_qap_with_groth16.rs` is a binary crate implementing a zero-knowledge
proof of a solution to a simple system of linear equations using the Groth16 protocol

# Acknowledgements

The [RareSkills book](https://www.rareskills.io/zk-book) on zero-knowledge proofs was an
incredibly helpful resource in getting started with the topic in general, as well as helping me
try to understand the Groth16 and Bulletproofs protocols.

I found several resources on the PlonK protocol very useful in trying to understand parts of
it (in particular, the "permutation argument" used to enforce copy constraints among wires in a
PlonK-ish arithmetic circuit):

PlonK](https://medium.com/coinmonks/under-the-hood-of-zksnarks-plonk-protocol-part-1-34bc406d8303)
- [David Wong's YouTube videos on
PlonK](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBJMt6zV1c7Gh9Utg-Vng2V6EYVidTFCC)
- [Vitalik Buterin's post on PlonK](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2019/09/22/plonk.html)

The crates in the [`arkworks` ecosystem](https://github.com/arkworks-rs) have been very solid
in my usage of them and the documentation has been helpful, so many thanks to all the
contributors to the `arkworks` crates!
